## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  that contains integers. You need to print the elements of the array in a single line with a space between them.
 **Note:**  Don't add a new line at the end.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [54, 43, 2, 1, 5]
Output: 54 43 2 1 5
Explanation: Just traverse and print the numbers.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [324, 5, 2, 2]

        for(int i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
            // return arr + " ";
            System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
        }
